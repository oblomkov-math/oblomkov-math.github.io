  <b> Overview </b>
  <br><br>
  We are planning to cover basics of representation theory of Lie algebras. The main focus is the conctrete examples of simple Lie algebras
  of lower rank as well as classical simple Lie algebras.
 <br>
<br>
  <b>Main  Textbook </b><br>
  <br>
   Representation theory: a first course, by W. Fulton, J. Harris
  <br> I also plan to hand some notes in class. <br>
